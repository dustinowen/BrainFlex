### Project: Brain Flex

###### 1. Glow...
Really the entire JS page is a glow. It was a big challenge for me that I got through with help from my cohort. I do love the brain icons changing with the amount of lives left, but would like to improve upon this with a life meter directly below the brains. 

###### 2. Grow...
A few bugs that I did not have time to fully remove but do not necessarily affect function:
* Can click the same card multiple times. Would like to build a key in each levels object to mark the image as usable/non-usable.
* I think I will adjust how many lives you get based on easy/medium/hard (which will require scoreboard adjustements as well). With everything working it's tough game with only 5 lives - good luck!
